<p>A group of Indian farmers set up a fake IPL cricket tournament so convincing that they managed to trick Russian gamblers into placing real bets. According to <a target="_blank" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/fake-ipl-in-gujarat-village-dupes-russian-punters/articleshow/92789976.cms">a report from the <em>Times of India</em></a>, the fake games took place on a farm in the village of Gujarat, with 21 farm laborers and unemployed teens who were each paid 400 rupees (~$5 USD) and tasked with impersonating “pro” cricket players from well-known Indian teams.</p><p></p><p><img src="statamic://asset::assets::cricket-1.webp" alt=""></p><p>The farmers reportedly livestreamed the tournament to YouTube over the course of two weeks and even set up a Telegram channel dedicated to the games. That’s where they took bets from Russian gamblers located in Tver, Voronezh, and Moscow, despite the fact that the actual IPL’s 2022 season <em>closed out in late May</em>.</p><p>Even with the season &quot;over&quot;, the farmers managed to dupe its Russian audience anyway, thanks to some clever thinking and a makeshift setup. They set up five HD cameras and halogen lights around the field, as well as added sound effects that mimicked the noise from a real crowd.</p><p>Players swapped between jerseys belonging to the Chennai Super Kings, Mumbai Indians, and Gujarat Titans, while an “umpire” paraded the field with walkie-talkies. As the games progressed, one man took on the role of famous cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle, who actually acknowledged the group’s epic scam on Twitter.</p><p>Shoeb Davda, one of the masterminds behind the phony tournament, fed instructions to the umpire based on the live bets they received from the Russians. The umpire would then make a signal to the batsman and bowler to steer bets in their favour. Indian police busted four of the savvy con men during the tournament’s “quarter-finals,” who were just taking delivery of 300,000 rupees (~$3,775 USD) from Russian bettors before the shutdown.</p><p></p><p><strong><em>Remember our Football tips start at the end of the month.
